/**
 * dsh-genui browser half: the ```dsh-ui fence renderer.
 *
 * The render_ui toolview, the session panel dock, and the /panel slash
 * command were removed at the operator's request — the inline fence is the
 * only UI surface. The panel store/toolview modules remain in the tree for
 * potential revival but are no longer wired in.
 *
 * Fence rendering is dual-mode, chosen at boot:
 * - **Registry channel** (contract hosts): the host's MarkdownText resolves
 *   ```dsh-ui fences through the fence-registry extension point; this package
 *   registers `renderGenuiFence`. Action callbacks ride the host-installed
 *   GenuiActionContext.
 * - **DOM channel** (pristine hosts): no extension point exists, so
 *   `dom-fence.ts` observes the conversation DOM, finds settled stock code
 *   blocks labelled `dsh-ui`, and mounts the same render pipeline in its own
 *   React roots — wrapped in the plugin-owned GenuiActionContext that relays
 *   `[genui-action]` through the scoped conversation send. Either way the
 *   deployment is the STOCK DSH snapshot plus this plugin.
 *
 * The renderer parses the fence body with the partial parser: while the reply
 * streams, every FINISHED component appears the moment its JSON object
 * closes, so the UI assembles top-down before the fence (or reply) completes.
 * A body with no finished component yet falls back to a plain code block.
 * @module @omdsh-dev/dsh-genui/client
